# TopHiggsMEManalysis
Tools designed to help MEMmultilepton analyses

1) FlatTreeMEMproducer: produces MEM results provided a flat tree as input

2) SubGradientMinimizer: a custom minimizer, alternative to Minuit, designed to be a good local minimum finder for MEM kinematic fits problems

3) DelphesAnalyzer: from Delphes samples, produces flat trees that can be used as input to the MEM (at the moment ttZ only)
